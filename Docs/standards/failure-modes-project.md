# Failure modes: HogNoise

**Status:** Living. Seeded on 2026-10-31. This project's ledger: how the process has gone wrong here, as triggers. It is
the project's to edit and starts without entries. The framework's own lessons are in
[failure-modes.md](failure-modes.md); read both before starting work, because retrieval is the enforcement.

Entries are append-only and numbered `P-1`, `P-2`, ... so a cross-reference to "framework 5" or "project P-1" is
unambiguous. Never rewrite one; add a new entry that supersedes it and say which.

## The shape of an entry

```markdown
### P-1 · A short name for the failure

**Trigger:** What you would notice at the moment it applies.
**Do:** The action it should cause.
**Because:** The pull request or commit that proves it, and what happened.
```

## How to add an entry

When the process fails, append the entry in the same pull request as the fix. Mechanise the class when a check can, and
name the check in the entry. If any repository would repeat the failure, propose the entry to the template instead.
